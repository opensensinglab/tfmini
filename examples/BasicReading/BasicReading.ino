Example code for Benewake TFMini time-of-flight distance sensor. 
by Peter Jansen (December 11/2017)
This example code is in the public domain.

This example communicates to the TFMini using a SoftwareSerial port at 115200, 
while communicating the distance results through the default Arduino hardware
Serial debug port. 

SoftwareSerial for some boards can be unreliable at high speeds (such as 115200). 
The driver includes some limited error detection and automatic retries, that
means it can generally work with SoftwareSerial on (for example) an UNO without
the end-user noticing many communications glitches, as long as a constant refresh
rate is not required. 

The (UNO) circuit:
 * Uno RX is digital pin 10 (connect to TX of TF Mini)
 * Uno TX is digital pin 11 (connect to RX of TF Mini)
